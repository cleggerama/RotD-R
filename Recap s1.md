**The Tale of the Vigil of Light**  
_Told by Father, to his daughter Anna_

Father shifted Anna on his lap, her small form nestled against his chest. She fidgeted for a moment, her face scrunched with anticipation.

"Tonight’s story begins in Rybalka," Father began softly, the familiar cadence of his voice drawing her in. "Far to the north, in the harsh lands of the Klavek Kingdom. The Vigil of Light was upon them, a night of hope and ritual—"

"But I already know about the vigil!" Anna interrupted impatiently. "Everyone goes to the cathedral, and they say a bunch of old words and hold up a rock, right? Get to the part where things get scary!"

Father chuckled, stroking her head as she sighed in frustration. "You must learn to be patient, Anna," he said. "If we skip to the end, you’ll miss the pieces that make the story whole. Even the heroes have to wait for the right moment."

Anna crossed her arms but nodded begrudgingly, her curiosity bubbling under the surface. "Okay, fine," she murmured. "But don’t take _too_ long."

Father smiled and continued.

**The Vigil of Light**

_The village of Rybalka was gathered under the high arches of the cathedral, a building that stood as a symbol of the new rule, the power of the Klavek. The villagers shuffled inside, their breaths turning to mist in the frigid air, their faces tense with anticipation as they made their way to the warmth and light of the sacred space. Tonight was special—tonight marked the end of the Longest Night, a night that once carried terror and death with it. But for five years now, the Vigil of Light had kept the shadows at bay._

Anna's fingers tightened around her stuffed rabbit as she listened, her eyes intent on her father’s words.

_Among the crowd were four heroes—Zelda, Phaerae Niraban, Yrsa Ulfhild, and Guthlaf the Red. Each had their own reason for being there, though some were more eager than others._

"Like Guthlaf!" Anna piped up, grinning. "He didn’t even want to go, did he?"

Father chuckled. "That’s right, Anna. Guthlaf would have preferred to be at the Thirsty Serpent, where the ale was warm and his spirits were high. But even he knew that on the Longest Night, it was best to be among the people, where safety was stronger in numbers. And besides," Father winked, "he remembered a time before the cathedral—when monsters crept from the woods and dragged people into the dark."

Anna shivered with excitement but said nothing, her impatience melting away as the story unfolded.

_The four heroes joined the villagers, their eyes drawn to the High Priest Juriendor, who stood at the altar, preparing the ceremony. With a slow, deliberate motion, he drew a wooden torch from the wall and ignited it in the great brazier, filling the cathedral with a sudden brilliance like daylight. The people sighed with relief as the warmth washed over them, and for a moment, the shadows seemed to retreat entirely._

_But something was strange about the ritual this time. Phaerae Niraban, the ever-watchful cleric of the god of light, felt a disquiet deep in her bones. The chanting was… off. It was something more ancient, something wilder than the rituals she had been taught. Unease crept up her spine as she slowly backed away from the ceremony, her eyes flicking to the doors of the cathedral. She didn’t trust this place—not fully. She made sure the villagers weren’t trapped, that no dark magic would claim their lives._

Anna’s breath hitched as she clung to every word.

_Meanwhile, the High Priest Juriendor continued the ritual. He unclipped a small, old wooden box from his armor, and inside was the Moonshard—a stone that shimmered with an ethereal light. Zelda, the young and curious girl who had recently stayed behind when the traveling circus moved on, was captivated. The glowing stone called to her in a way that few things did. She watched, her eyes wide with fascination as Juriendor raised the stone high, chanting words in a mystic language._

Anna grinned. "Zelda loves shiny things," she whispered.

Father nodded. "She does, indeed. But not all things that shine are safe, my dear."

_Guthlaf, lost in thought—likely dreaming of the ale waiting for him at the Thirsty Serpent—was suddenly snapped back to the present when he recognized the tone of Juriendor’s words. It wasn’t the voice of a god of war. No, this was something more ancient, something tied to nature itself. Guthlaf frowned, confusion filling his mind as he spoke aloud, 'A nature god?'_

_Juriendor’s chanting only grew louder, and with each word, the Moonshard’s glow intensified, filling the cathedral with an energy that thrummed in the very air. The villagers watched in awe, though a few shared Phaerae and Guthlaf’s confusion. Yrsa Ulfhild, a daughter of the land and a woman with little trust in the Klavek ways, narrowed her eyes at the High Priest. She had seen the box before. It was no artifact of the Klavek—this was something older, something likely taken from her own people or another tribe. Her suspicion deepened._

_Suddenly, the peaceful glow of the ceremony was shattered by a loud, desperate banging on the cathedral doors. 'Please! We need help! We’ve been cut to shreds out here!'_

Anna’s heart raced as she gripped her father’s arm. "Who was at the door? What happened?"

Father smiled gently, brushing a stray curl from her face. "Two men stumbled in, each carrying a gravely wounded companion. They were battered, barely standing, their armor torn and bloodied."

_Phaerae, ever the vigilant protector, rushed to open the doors. The two men staggered inside, their breath labored, eyes wide with fear. The villagers gasped and pulled back as the injured were laid before them._

_The ritual was interrupted, but the question still lingered in the air—was the danger outside the doors, or had something even darker already slipped inside?_

Anna squirmed with excitement. "Did the monsters come back?" she asked, her voice tinged with both fear and anticipation.

Father smiled, stroking her hair. "Ah, they did, but not in the way you might expect. Now, hush and listen carefully."

Anna settled down, wide-eyed, hugging her stuffed rabbit close to her chest.

_As the two injured men were tended to, High Priest Juriendor began the ritual once again, lifting the Moonshard high. The stone’s glow spread across the cathedral, its light warm and pure, driving back the shadows. But just as the tension began to ease, the cathedral doors were thrown open once more—this time by a group of hunters. They barged in, their torches ablaze, shouting strange things. 'We must enhance the light!' they cried. 'Only the light can hold back the darkness!'_

Father paused, looking down at Anna, whose fingers were tight around her rabbit. "You remember the hunters, don’t you?"

Anna nodded eagerly. "Yrsa and Guthlaf recognized them. They come to Holly’s Hocks to sell the meat they catch in the woods!"

"Very good, Anna," Father said. "But this time, the hunters were not themselves. Their eyes were wide, pupils dilated like they were under a spell."

Anna gasped, eyes gleaming with worry. "Were they okay?"

Father shook his head slowly. "Not at first. They weren’t in their right minds. They started setting fire to the tapestries hanging on the cathedral walls."

_Chaos began to spread as the hunters acted with wild abandon, flames licking up the beautiful old tapestries. But the four heroes would not stand by idly. Guthlaf, ever the brute, had a simple solution—he just punched one of the hunters square in the jaw, snapping him out of his trance with sheer force._

Anna giggled at the image of Guthlaf’s large fists knocking sense into the man. "Guthlaf is so funny," she said. "But what did the others do?"

_Yrsa, the druid, acted with precision. She saw a hunter with a torch, his glazed eyes focused on spreading the flames. With a sharp swipe of her staff, she knocked the torch from his hand and stomped it out beneath her boot. Phaerae, the watchful cleric, saw another hunter at the far end of the cathedral, poised to set yet another tapestry alight. Without hesitation, she raised her crossbow, firing a bolt with deadly accuracy that stopped the hunter in his tracks._

Anna gasped again. "Phaerae’s crossbow is so cool!"

Father grinned. "It is indeed. But Zelda had her own way of dealing with the danger. The flames had already spread to the rafters, far beyond the reach of most. But Zelda, with her strange and mysterious magic, whispered a spell. The flames suddenly snuffed out, like candles blown by an invisible wind, leaving only charred wood behind."

_With the hunters subdued and the fires extinguished, the villagers let out a collective breath of relief. But before anyone could rest, Juriendor lifted the Moonshard once more. This time, his voice echoed with power as he chanted words of ancient magic, the light of the stone growing brighter, brighter still, until it filled the entire cathedral. Then, with a sudden burst, the light formed into a swirling gateway of energy, hovering in the air above the stone. For a moment, the room was still._

Anna’s heart raced. "What came through the gateway?"

Father leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Through the portal came something terrible."

_Orbs of light emerged first—small, glowing spheres that floated like wisps. But then the light began to warp, twisting unnaturally toward the orbs. And before anyone could comprehend what was happening, the light coalesced into a dark, swirling mass—an orb of pure shadow. The villagers gasped in terror as the dark orb began to spin wildly around Juriendor. Without warning, it lashed out with bolts of freezing darkness, striking the High Priest and sending him crashing to the floor!_

Anna clutched her rabbit tighter, her eyes wide with fear. "Did Juriendor die?"

Father shook his head. "Not yet, little one, but he was in grave danger. The Moonshard slipped from his hands, falling through the cracks in the floor. It was lost, pulled down into the depths below the cathedral. And without it, the shadows grew stronger."

_The orb of darkness circled above Juriendor, its icy rays striking him again and again. Then, before any of the heroes could react, one of the villagers—a brave man with desperation in his eyes—grabbed a metal candlestick from the end of a pew and rushed at the orb. He swung with all his might, but the creature was unaffected. The orb lashed out with a dark ray, and the man collapsed to his knees, gasping in pain._

_Panic erupted as the villagers scattered, running in every direction—some fleeing toward the doors, others rushing up the stairs to escape. But Yrsa, Guthlaf, Zelda, and Phaerae stood firm. They knew they had to stop the creature before it killed Juriendor—and perhaps everyone else._

_Yrsa acted first, summoning her druidic magic. She scooped up a handful of pebbles from the ground, whispered to them, and hurled them at the orb. Each pebble struck with the force of a boulder, shattering into the dark mass, but the creature remained unyielding._

_Guthlaf, gritting his teeth, raised his battle ax high and charged forward. He swung with all his might, striking the orb as it dipped low. When it rose into the air, Guthlaf hurled his throwing axes, each one embedding itself into the swirling darkness before falling away. But with each hit, the orb retaliated—its dark rays lashed out, striking Guthlaf’s skin and turning it black, the flesh necrotizing beneath the surface._

Anna covered her mouth in shock. "Was he okay?"

Father nodded reassuringly. "Thanks to Phaerae. She switched between her crossbow and her healing magic, keeping Guthlaf and the others alive with her divine light."

_Even Augie, old as he was, took up his longbow and fired arrows with the precision of a hunter half his age. He hit the orb again and again, but it wasn’t until his final shot—a perfect, well-aimed strike—that the orb began to falter._

_With Augie’s arrow piercing its core, the dark orb shrieked and collapsed in on itself, vanishing into nothingness. The danger was gone, but Juriendor remained on the floor, gasping for breath as the acolytes rushed to his aid._

Anna let out a long breath, relieved. "But what about the Moonshard?"

Father’s expression grew serious. "It was gone—lost beneath the floorboards. Juriendor knew the artifact was the key to stopping the darkness outside. But before he could ask for help, more danger arrived."

_Suddenly, screams echoed from outside. The villagers who had fled returned in a panic, rushing back into the sanctuary. Something terrible was outside, chasing them back into the cathedral. The villagers tried to bar the doors, but in that moment, an acolyte burst down from the stairs leading to the bell tower, shouting in terror: 'Fire! The bell tower is on fire!'_

_Phaerae and Yrsa shared a grim look. The entire village could perish if the bell tower collapsed. And with monsters outside, there would be no escape._

_Juriendor, weak but still conscious, called out from the floor, 'Yrsa, Guthlaf, take these hearty souls and stop the fire in the bell tower! I will head down and try to recover the Moonshard. It is the key to stopping the monsters outside. Come find me and help if you can, once the bell tower is safe!'_

_The four heroes ran toward the stairs. As Guthlaf ran by, he called to Augie, 'You coming, old man?'_

Anna giggled again. "And Augie stayed behind, didn’t he?"

Father nodded. "He did. Augie stayed to protect the villagers from whatever horrors were outside, while Guthlaf, Yrsa, Phaerae, and Zelda rushed up the stairs to stop the fire. But what they found at the top was even worse."

_As the heroes reached the top of the tower, they encountered two fiery mephits—winged devils from the underworld. The creatures spit fire, and their bodies blazed with an unholy heat. But they weren’t alone. The bell ropes—the long, thick cords that hung from the ceiling—had come to life!_

Anna gasped in surprise. "Were the ropes bad too?"

Father shook his head. "No, little one. The ropes were good. They tangled with the mephits, helping the heroes by pulling the devils down from the air and tying them up, giving them the chance to strike!"

_Guthlaf charged forward, swinging his battle ax at the fiery creatures. When they floated too high, he hurled his hand axes, bringing them crashing back down. Yrsa, as always, used her enchanted stones, turning small pebbles into mighty boulders that smashed into the mephits. Zelda called upon her dark magic, her body enveloped by twisting purple tentacles that shielded her from the flames. And Phaerae was there, healing every burn and bruise with her divine power, all while firing her crossbow to keep the mephits at bay._

_Even as the heroes fought, the bell ropes pulled and twisted, wrapping around the mephits and holding them still. The battle was fierce, but with each strike, the fiery devils grew weaker. One by one, they exploded into bursts of flame, leaving only embers behind._

Father’s voice grew softer. "But even as they fought the mephits, the sound of strange crackling energy came from above, and a sharp tang of ozone filled the air."

Anna’s eyes grew wide. "What was waiting for them?"

Father leaned in close, whispering. "That, my dear, is where we must end the story tonight."

"Nooo!" Anna groaned, pulling away slightly. "Not again!"

Father chuckled softly. "Patience, little one. The story will continue soon. And when it does, we’ll find out what terrible things await them at the top of the bell tower."

Anna pouted but smiled soon after. "Okay. But next time, you have to tell me _everything_ that happens!"

Father nodded, giving her a kiss on the forehead. "Of course, Anna. Every last detail."
