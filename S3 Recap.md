The Pursuit into the Dark Wood
Told by a man, to his daughter Anna

Anna snuggled deeper into her father’s lap, her eyes reflecting the soft glow of the fireplace. “Daddy,” she whispered, “you promised to tell me what happened when the heroes went into the Dark Wood.”

Her father smiled gently, brushing a stray hair from her face. “Ah, yes. The tale continues as our brave heroes face even greater dangers.”

A New Companion

After the fierce battle outside the cathedral, the heroes took a moment to catch their breaths. As they surveyed the aftermath, they discovered a small man named Veda crawling out from under a wagon. He had a nasty bump on his head and was clearly dazed.

“Are you all right?” Phaerae asked, kneeling beside him.

“I… I think so,” Veda mumbled, touching the bandage Guthlaf wrapped around his head. “Those dark elves caught me by surprise.”

Despite his injury, Veda insisted on joining the group. “I can’t let them get away with this,” he said determinedly. The heroes welcomed his help, knowing they needed all the assistance they could get to rescue the kidnapped villagers and recover the Moonshard.

The Fork in the Road

They set off, following the tracks of the drow and their prisoners into the dense forest. The path was treacherous, shadows lurking between the trees. As they reached a sharp turn in the road, Zelda nearly stepped into a cleverly concealed pit.

“Watch out!” Yrsa shouted.

Zelda jumped back just in time. “That was close!” she exclaimed, her eyes wide.

From the pit, disturbed by the commotion, emerged several drow zombies. Their lifeless eyes fixed on the party as they clawed their way upward.

“Seems they left us a welcoming party,” Guthlaf remarked, gripping his axe.

The battle was swift but fierce. Yrsa’s enchanted stones struck true, and Guthlaf’s axe cleaved through the undead with ease. Veda, focusing his mind, conjured glowing blades from thin air—psychic knives that he hurled at the zombies with deadly accuracy. The knives sliced through the air, dissipating after they struck their targets.

Phaerae’s mysterious purple light filled the zombies with dread, causing them to falter. Zelda used her dark magic to bind the remaining foes, making them easy targets.

Once the zombies were defeated, Yrsa noticed something. “Look here,” she said, pointing to tracks veering off the main path. “A smaller group broke away from the main party.”

“They’re taking the Moonshard through the hunter’s trail,” Guthlaf surmised. “It’s a shortcut north, but rough terrain for those carrying prisoners.”

“Then we still have a chance to catch them,” Zelda said excitedly.

The group decided to follow the northern trail, hoping to intercept the drow before they could escape deeper into the Dark Wood.

The Wolves of the Dark Wood

Hours passed as they navigated the twisting path. The forest grew darker, the trees gnarled and twisted. Suddenly, the silence was broken by a low, menacing growl.

A massive dire wolf emerged from the shadows, its eyes swirling with black liquid, fangs dripping with a sinister, caustic ichor. Six wolves flanked it, their stares fixed on the intruders.

“Something’s not right with that beast,” Yrsa murmured.

“No time to ponder,” Guthlaf replied, readying his weapon. “Here they come!”

The wolves attacked with ferocity. Yrsa transformed into her giant hyena form, meeting the dire wolf head-on. Guthlaf fought off two wolves at once, his laughter echoing as he reveled in the combat.

Veda stood back, his eyes narrowing in concentration. With swift motions, he summoned his psychic blades, their ethereal glow cutting through the darkness. He flung them one after another, each blade finding its mark and vanishing upon impact. Zelda used her dark magic to create illusions, confusing the wolves and leading them into traps.

Phaerae’s healing spells kept everyone on their feet, mending wounds almost as quickly as they were inflicted. The dire wolf lunged at Yrsa, but she dodged deftly, allowing Guthlaf to strike a critical blow.

Finally, the dire wolf fell, dissolving into a pool of dark ichor that seeped into the ground.

“What was that stuff?” Veda asked, catching his breath.

Phaerae knelt beside the puddle. “Corruption,” she said softly. “The Dark Wood is tainted.”

Encounter with the Centaurs

As they continued, the path was blocked by two imposing centaurs. Their expressions were stern, eyes filled with disdain.

“Halt, humanites!” the larger one bellowed. “You trespass on sacred ground. A blood price must be paid.”

Veda stepped forward. “We mean no disrespect. We’re pursuing dangerous foes who have—”

“Silence!” the centaur snapped. “Your kind always brings trouble.”

They hurled insults at Veda, Zelda, and Phaerae, mocking their stature and questioning their worth. Zelda, ever the optimist, began to sing.

Her voice was light and cheerful as she sang a song praising the might of centaurs and playfully jesting about the weaknesses of “humanites.” The centaurs paused, their stern faces softening as they listened. Slowly, they began to nod to the rhythm, and soon they were dancing along, hooves stamping the forest floor.

Guthlaf chuckled. “Never underestimate the power of a good tune.”

But the moment of peace was short-lived. The larger centaur, noticing Phaerae’s stern gaze, scowled. “You there!” he pointed. “Dorkus demands that the crunchy humanite kneel in submission. Dorkus no like your face shape!”

Phaerae crossed her arms, her eyes unwavering. “I will not kneel.”

The centaur’s face twisted in anger. “Then you will suffer!”

The Transformation

As the centaurs prepared to attack, something unexpected happened. Zelda’s cheerful demeanor vanished. Her form shifted, and she transformed into a striking woman clad in tight leather armor, her flowing white hair contrasting sharply with the dark energy pulsating in her eyes.

The centaurs stepped back in fear. “What sorcery is this?” Borkus exclaimed.

“You had your chance to live,” Zelda’s voice echoed, cold and resonant. “Now, we will kill you, and I will feast on your souls.”

The centaurs hesitated, terror gripping them. They attempted to flee, but Guthlaf and Yrsa blocked their path. The battle ensued.

Veda moved with swift precision, summoning his psychic blades. He hurled them at the centaurs, each blade striking true before dissipating. His attacks were relentless, but the centaurs were formidable opponents.

One of the centaurs charged at Veda, nearly knocking him off his feet. Phaerae rushed to his aid, her healing magic knitting his wounds even as the battle raged around them.

Zelda’s terrifying presence unnerved the centaurs, causing their attacks to falter. Even when a third centaur appeared to aid his brothers, the heroes held their ground.

Yrsa, shifting back to her human form, called upon the forces of nature. Vines erupted from the ground, entangling the centaurs’ legs and hindering their movements. Guthlaf’s strength proved too much for them, his strikes precise and devastating.

The centaurs, realizing they were defeated, pleaded for mercy.

“Mercy?” Zelda sneered, her eyes glowing with dark energy. “Did you show any to us?”

Phaerae placed a gentle hand on Zelda’s arm. “Enough,” she said softly. “Let them go.”

Zelda hesitated, the darkness in her eyes flickering. Finally, she stepped back. “Very well. But cross our path again, and there will be no mercy.”

The centaurs scrambled away, disappearing into the forest.

A Moment of Reflection

As the adrenaline faded, the group tended to their wounds. Veda winced as Phaerae wrapped a bandage around his arm, her healing magic soothing the pain.

“Thank you,” he murmured. “I thought that might have been the end of me.”

“You’re a skilled fighter,” Phaerae replied. “Those blades of yours are remarkable.”

Veda smiled faintly. “A trick or two
