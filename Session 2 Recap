The Battle Beneath the Cathedral

The man shifted in his chair, holding Anna close as she rested her head against his chest. She looked up at him, eyes gleaming with curiosity.

“Is this the part where the heroes go underground, Daddy?” Anna asked, her voice full of anticipation.

The man smiled and nodded. “Yes, Anna. This is where the real danger begins.”

After stopping the fire in the bell tower, the heroes—Zelda, Yrsa, Guthlaf, and Phaerae—barely had a moment to catch their breath before young Bjorn, the acolyte, came rushing toward them. His face was pale, and his voice shook with fear.

“The High Priest Juriendor!” he gasped. “He went down into the basement to find the Moonshard, but he’s been attacked by a horde of undead—zombies and skeletons!”

There was no hesitation. The heroes followed Bjorn down the stairs into the basement levels of the cathedral. It was dark and cold, the stone walls damp with age. The deeper they descended, the more ancient and foreboding the halls became.

The Undead Goblins

Anna squeezed her father’s arm. “Were there monsters right away?”

He smiled. “Oh yes. And they weren’t just ordinary monsters.”

As the group made their way through the first basement level, they heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps—shuffling, dragging footsteps. Rounding a corner, they were greeted by the sight of several goblins, their bodies twisted and decayed. These were no longer living creatures, but undead ghouls.

Yrsa, ever alert, used her magic to imbue small stones with incredible power, hurling them at the ghoublins. Guthlaf followed close behind, his battle ax cutting through the undead creatures with ease. Zelda’s tendrils of dark magic whipped out, grabbing at the ghoulish goblins and pulling them apart. Phaerae used her crossbow to help finish them off, always watching her companions, keping them safe, ready to heal any wounds they might suffer.

The goblins, though vicious, were no match for the heroes. But as they continued their descent, the true dangers revealed themselves.

Zelda and the Trap

Anna bit her lip. “But then Zelda got hurt, didn’t she?”

The man nodded. “She did, because she let her curiosity get the best of her.”

In one of the rooms where the ghoublins lurked, Zelda’s sharp eyes caught sight of something shiny. On the far side of the room, a ring glinted in the faint light. Without waiting for the others to check for traps, she rushed forward, eager to claim the shiny object.

“Zelda, wait!” Phaerae called out, but it was too late.

As soon as Zelda crossed the threshold, a cacophonous shrieking sound erupted, filling the air with an ear-splitting noise. It was a trap—designed to hurt any who entered unprepared. Zelda, caught in the blast, winced in pain, clutching her head.

The group rushed to her aid, pulling her out of the trap’s range, but the damage had been done.

Anna frowned. “Zelda has to learn to be more careful.”

Anna's father chuckled. “She does. But even the bravest heroes make mistakes.”

The Ambush

Not long after they dealt with the trap, the group was ambushed. What they thought were zombies lumbering toward them turned out to be something far more sinister—drow, dark elves from the Underdark, disguised as the undead. The battle was fierce, but the heroes fought with everything they had. Yrsa, Guthlaf, and Zelda dispatched the drow while Phaerae used her crossbow to harm the drow and her healing magic to keep everyone alive.

“This wasn’t just an attack,” Phaerae muttered, her brow furrowed. “Someone planned this.”

Anna’s eyes widened. “The drow! I knew they were bad!”

He nodded gravely. “Indeed. The heroes realized the attacks on the cathedral weren’t just random—there was something much darker at play.”

The Crypt

After dealing with the goblins and the trap, the group descended even further into the crypt, now two levels below the main sanctuary. The air was cold, the walls lined with ancient tombs. It was there they saw him—High Priest Juriendor, surrounded by dozens of zombies and skeletons, barely holding them off. 

Yrsa, ever the protector, didn’t hesitate. She called upon her druidic powers, transforming into a giant hyena, a fierce beast with powerful jaws and quick reflexes.

Zelda, her dark magic swirling around her, summoned tendrils of shadow that tore through the undead. Guthlaf, with his massive axe, cleaved zombies in half, one after another. But no matter how many they defeated, more seemed to take their place.

“There’s too many of them!” Guthlaf growled, his voice strained as he swung his axe.

Phaerae, watching the onslaught, knew it was time to act. She raised her holy symbol and called out to her god, Hivaka, a name unfamiliar to the rest of the group. As she spoke his name, the zombies and skeletons began to panic. They recoiled from Phaerae and from the holy symbol of Hivaka, their eyes wide with terror. Crawling over each other, they tried to escape, their fear overwhelming them.

“Who… what god is that?” Guthlaf muttered, glancing at Phaerae.

But Phaerae said nothing. She focused only on her spell, and with the undead repelled, Juriendor was able to crawl to safety behind the heroes.

Anna’s voice was small. “I don’t think they know who Hivaka is.”

His voice lowered. “They don’t, but eventually they will. And Phaerae will have to deal with that when the time comes.”

The Giant Spider

Just as the group thought they had a moment to breathe, the ground beneath them began to shake. The crypt trembled as a massive hole opened in the floor, and out of it crawled a giant spider, its legs smashing through tombstones and crypt lids, sending shards flying everywhere.

The heroes didn’t hesitate. Yrsa, still in her hyena form, sank her teeth into one of the spider’s legs, holding it down while Guthlaf swung his axe, chopping through the creature’s bristly limbs. But the spider was ready for them, suddenly dropping ten feet into a large cavity it had created just for this purpose. Yrsa fell down into the pit, where the spider began to try to spin her in a web. But Guthlaf jumped down after it, giving an exultant battle cry as he did so, and swinging his axe down in a bloody arc.

Zelda, dark magic swirling around her, lashed out with her tendrils, trying to disinitgrate the spider. And Phaerae, always ready, healed any wounds her companions suffered as they fought.

Together, they managed to bring the giant spider crashing to the ground. But just as they did, they realized the drow had escaped down the tunnel the spider had come from, taking the Moonshard with them.

The tunnel had collapsed behind the spider, leaving no way for the heroes to follow.

The Sanctuary

Rushing back upstairs, the heroes hoped to find another way to catch the drow. But when they returned to the sanctuary, they found a terrible scene.

Augie, the brave old hunter, lay on the floor, bleeding. His quiver was empty, but around him lay five dead drow, each with one or more of his arrows sticking out of them. He had fought valiantly, but the rest of the villagers were gone—taken by the remaining drow.

Anna’s lip quivered. “Augie … he tried so hard.”

The man nodded solemnly. “He did, Anna. But the drow were too many. They had taken the villagers and fled into the Dark Wood, a place of terrible corruption and evil, north of the village.”

The Ambush

With no time to waste, the heroes planned to follow the trail of blood into the forest, but as they came out of the cathedral, they were ambushed. Grimlocks and squamps attacked from the shadows, and six drow assassins, hidden in the trees, waited to strike.

Stepping from the brush, a lone drow lieutenant, clad in ebony armor, spoke in a cold, guttural tongue. ‘End them, brothers. Yoflid has enough cattle.’

The drow cast a powerful Darkness spell, shrouding the heroes in magical blackness. But Yrsa, still in her hyena form, didn’t need to see—she could smell the drow. She and Guthlaf tore through the enemy lines, while Zelda and Phaerae, hiding behind a wagon, shot  crossbow bolts and cast spells, keeping the drow at bay.

“But it was Phaerae who saved the day again,” the man said proudly, “when she remembered the scroll Bjorn had given her. It contained the Daylight spell, and when she cast it, the darkness vanished, replaced by a golden light as bright as the sun.”

The drow, unaccustomed to the light, were blinded, while the heroes could now see clearly. With this advantage, they swiftly defeated the remaining drow. But their victory was bittersweet, for the main group of drow, along with the Moonshard and the villagers, had escaped into the Dark Wood.

Anna was quiet for a moment, her small hand clutching her father’s sleeve. “Do they go into the Dark Wood, Daddy?”

His voice was gentle. “That, my dear, is a tale for another night.”

Anna groaned softly but nodded. “Okay… but next time, you have to tell me what happens in the Dark Wood!”

The man smiled and kissed her forehead. “I promise, Anna. Next time, we’ll see what dangers lie in that cursed forest.”
